Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.

it's depend on Local Operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.and the git tracking the changes every single changes and the GIT detect the corruption of the files and losses files .

#The Life Cycle of File Status
* After you edit a file, Git flags it as modified because of changes made after the previous commit.
* You stage the modified file.
* Then, you commit staged changes.
