# Chapter 17

* The new HTML5 elements reference the target of
different parts of a web page and help to represent
its structure.
 * The new elements supply clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.


# chapter 8

* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code among the `<!-- and -->` markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as `<, >,` and `Â©`.
