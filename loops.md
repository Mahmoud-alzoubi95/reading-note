# comparision operators : 
**evaluating condition**

* == ( is equal to ) , this operater compares tow values to see if they are the same .

* != ( is not equal to ) , this operater compares tow values to see if they are not the same .

* === ( strickt equal to ) , this operator compares tow values to check that both the data type and the value are the same .

* !== (strickt not equal to) , this operator compares tow values to check that both the data type and the value are not the same .

* >    ( greater than  than ) , this operators check if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right .

* <    ( less than  than ) , this operators check if the number on the left is less than the number on the right .



## LOGICAL OPERATORS :
**logical operators allow you to campare the results of more than one comparison operator .**

- && ( logical and ) , this operator tests more than one condition .

- II ( logical or ) ,  this operator tests at least one condition .

- ! ( logical not ) , this operator tekes a single boolean value and inverts it .

## LOOPS :
loops chick a condition , if it return true , a code block will run . then the condition will be checked a gain and if
it still true ,the ccode block will run again . it repeat until  the condition returns false .

## TYPES OF LOOPS :
1. FOR LOOP 
2. WHILE LOOP
3.DO WHILE LOOP





* FOR LOOP :
if you need to run  code a specific nmber og times , use for loob .

* WHILE LOOP:
if you do not now how many times the code should run .
