# JS

java scribt makes web pages more interactive .  
such as select any element, attribute, or text from an
HTML page. 
You can use JavaScript to add
elements, attributes, and text to the
page, or remove them.

PROGRAM RULES
You can specify a set of steps for
the browser to follow (like a recipe),
which allows it to access or change the
content of a page.

EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT
IN THE BROWSER :
* SLIDESHOWS : Slideshows can display a number of different images


(or other HTML content) within the same space
on a given page.

* FORMS :
Validating forms (checking whether they have been
filled in correctly) is important when information is
supplied by users. 
JavaScript lets you alert the user
if mistakes have been made.

RELOAD PART OF PAGE :
You might not want to force visitors to reload the
content of an entire web page, particularly if you
only need to refresh a small portion of a page.

FILTERING DATA :
If you have a lot of information to display on a page,
you can help users find information they need by
providing filters. Here, buttons are generated using
data in the attributes of the HTML <img> elements.
When the user clicks on one of the buttons, they are
only shown the images with that keyword.

A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal.

To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.
a program must give the computer
enough detail to perform the task as if every time
were its first time.



1: DEFINE THE GOAL
2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT
3: CODE EACH STEP
