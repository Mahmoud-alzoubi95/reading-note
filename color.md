# COLOR 


## **You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:**
1. RGB values :
These express colors in terms
of how much red, green and
blue are used to make it up.

2. HEX codes :
These are six-digit codes that
represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color,
preceded by a pound or hash #
sign.

3. color names :
There are 147 predefined color
names that are recognized
by browsers.


## **background-color :**
You can specify your choice of
background color in the same
three ways you can specify
foreground colors .


## Understanding Color :
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red,
green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker. 

The color of every pixel on the
screen is expressed in terms of
a mix of red, green, and blue â€”
just like on a television screen.

* RGB Values : Values for red, green, and blue
are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
rgb(102,205,170) 

* Hex Codes : Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.

* Color Names : Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.


# Contrast 
1. Low Contrast : Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors. 

2. High Contrast : Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.

3. Medium Contrast : For long spans of text, reducing
the contrast a little bit improves readability.

## Opacity 
The CSS3 rgba property allows
you to specify a color, just like
you would with an RGB value,
but adds a fourth value to
indicate opacity. This value is
known as an alpha value and is
a number between 0.0 and 1.0
(so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity
and 0.15 is 15% opacity). The
rgba value will only affect the
element on which it is applied
(not child elements).



## HSL COLOR
CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive
way to specify colors using hue, saturation,
and lightness values.

1. HUE : 
Hue is the colloquial idea of
color. In HSL colors, hue is often
represented as a color circle
where the angle represents the
color, although it may also be
shown as a slider with values
from 0 to 360.

2. saturation
Saturation is the amount of
gray in a color. Saturation is
represented as a percentage.
100% is full saturation and 0%
is a shade of gray.

3. lightness
Lightness is the amount of
white (lightness) or black
(darkness) in a color. Lightness
is represented as a percentage.
0% lightness is black, 100%
lightness is white, and 50%
lightness is normal. Lightness
is sometimes referred to as
luminosity.
